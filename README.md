# Graph-Compression-for-Gaussian-Graphical-Model-Selection
This code repo corresponds to [Gaussian Graphical Model Selection Using Graph Compression] paper.

## Experiments
The main files to run are **Experiments_Graph Compression.ipynb** for graph compression and **Experiments_Model Selection.ipynb** for model selection experiments.

## Datasets
All datasets for graph compression can be found under **Datasets/**  

## Environments
